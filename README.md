# Business Problem
I got last @Türk_politika 3000 tweets with twiter.developer api and I analysed all his tweets with NLP method.
I chosen @türk_politika twitter account because he share valuable informations about foreign policy of Türkiye.
I am strongly recommending to follow this account on twiter.

# Code
I got all tweet content and split to each words. I filtered all content to delete nonsense words.

After that I used NLP method with wordcloud library and I analyse commonly used words and I ploted them as below.
